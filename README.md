Prerequisites: You will need VueJS 2.7.16 to run this properly
In order to run this project properly you will need to enter the backend project and complete all the steps and run the application.
Once you run the backend api for the first time you will get a url, we will need to update the App.vue file(line 14) with the url visual studio provided for the api in your computer
After you replaced the url you can go ahead and run "npm start" in the terminal
